# SQL To-Do List

## Description

Duration: 54 hours - evening 10/16/2020 - evening 10/18/2020

This project is a to do app that takes tasks to be completed from the input boxes on the DOM, and uses various http requests
to manipulate the data and send it back and forth to the server and display it on the DOM.  It takes an input box for text
to list the task, a dropdown box to select the category for the task, and a dropdown to select the urgency of the task.  There
are three levels of urgency to choose from and this determines which of the three tables the task is listed under.

The main challenge for the prohect was properly working with a database and inserting, removing, and editing data from it.  
The put request was a new component, as that had been learned since the previous project which did use GET and PUT requests.  

The project had an interesting component, in that Bootstrap was requested to be used for styling.  This was a bit challenging to learn, because I had 
an idea of how I wanted to style the project and I did a certain amount of this before I started to try to use Bootstrap.  Bootstrap made what I had done previously ineffective,
and I had to decide to take pieces of what it offered to use, but keep some of my own styling, and adjust the final outcome I had
envisioned, which looked and worked much better in the end, anyway.
